# CDSN - Cancer Detection & Segmentation Net

## Overview

This open-source project focuses on cancer detection using a cutting-edge architecture which harnesses the most of the current state of advanced segmentation to reduce disparities in the skill of doctors to detect cancer. The Q-Net (self-proclaimed) architecture has shown great promise in image segmentation tasks, making it a suitable choice for cancer detection in medical images.
